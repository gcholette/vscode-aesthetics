#  VS Code Aesthetics :sparkles:

VS Code Aesthetics is an extension that allows for deeper customisation than what normal themes permit, like gradients, glow effects and css animations on anything in the UI.

I currently use the extension with the 2077 theme https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Endormi.2077-theme

## How to use

1. Download the .vsix extension from the releases page https://github.com/gcholette/vscode-aesthetics/releases and install it manually. (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix)
2. In the command palette, the command "VS Code Aesthetics: Enable All" should be available

Please note that this project is still in early development.
