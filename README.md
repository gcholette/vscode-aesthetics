#  VS Code Aesthetics :sparkles:

VS Code Aesthetics is an extension that allows for injecting CSS files inside the workbench. This allows for deeper customisation than what normal themes permit, like gradients, glow effects and css animations on anything in the UI.

## How to use

1. Download the .vsix extension from the releases page https://github.com/gcholette/vscode-aesthetics/releases and install it manually. (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix)
2. In the command palette, the command "VS Code Aesthetics: Enable All" should be available

Please note that this project is still in early development.
